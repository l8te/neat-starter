In September 2021, I was accepted to Rutgers School of Information & Communication, and I started working towards my Master of Information degree. 

I wrote my first literature review on the information needs of members of the transgender community for Human Information Behavior, and created a [LibGuide on asexuality](https://comminfo.libguides.com/530-91-asexuality-basics) for Search and the Information Landscape.
